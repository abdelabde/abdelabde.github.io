Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Mathematics at [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/), supervised by [Issmail El Hallaoui](https://www.gerad.ca/fr/people/issmail-el-hallaoui) and [Loubna Benabbou](https://www.uqar.ca/universite/a-propos-de-l-uqar/departements/unites-departementales-des-sciences-de-la-gestion/benabbou-lobna). I study the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning and optimization in a broad range of paradigms. Understanding these foundations is central in the design of AI algorithms exclusively dedicated to combinatorial optimization. Before joining Polytechnique, I received an industrial engineering diploma from Mohammadia School of Engineering [(EMI)](https://www.emi.ac.ma/) in Rabat.
